# README Generator

A CLI application that generates a README.md file, utilizing user input.

## Install

This application runs in the terminal, so upon downloading, some additional files may be required.

Run the following into your terminal to get all the necessary files:

```bash
npm i
```

You should then receive all the files needed in the `node_modules/` directory.  

## Usage

You will then be prompted with questions. Answer accordingly, then a new `.md` file will be added to your current directory. This is the newly generated README file.
